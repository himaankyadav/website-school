Himaank had huge cravings for Indian food from India, and chose to open this restaurant to satisfy his own cravings, along with those of many other Indian immigrants like him, and also to introduce authentic Indian dishes to the western world, as Himaank believes Indian food should get more credit than it does.<br><br>Ever since its opening, Himaank's Indian Cuisine has gone viral amongst many in Toronto, Indians and non-Indians alike, with many videos featuring the restaurant on social media sites like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.
